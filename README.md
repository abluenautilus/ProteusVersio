Proteus is a generative sequencer. It creates a melody, then loops that melody for a while, until it gets bored and creates a new one. While it's looping the melody, it may transpose by octave or mutate individual notes as controlled by the knobs or CV.

The Versio hardware does not allow for CV/Gate out, so instead of putting out v/oct, this version of Proteus makes a full voice. The voice can be switched between a formant oscillator and a Karplus-Strong string voice using the bottom switch.
